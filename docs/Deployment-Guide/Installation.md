After navigating to your project directory, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies to ensure your Docusaurus site functions correctly. This step is crucial for setting up your development environment and preparing your project for local development and deployment.

**Navigate to Your Project Directory:**

First, open your command-line interface (CLI) or terminal and navigate to your Docusaurus project directory using the cd command. Replace my-docusaurus-site with the name of your project directory:

```
cd my-docusaurus-site
Install Necessary Dependencies
```
Once you're in your project directory, you can install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```
npm install
```
This command will read the package.json file in your project directory, which contains a list of dependencies required by your Docusaurus project, and install them locally.

**About npm install**
* npm install is a command used with npm (Node Package Manager) to install dependencies specified in the package.json file.
* It reads the package.json file and installs all dependencies listed under the dependencies and devDependencies sections.
* Dependencies are typically packages or libraries required by your project for development or runtime purposes.

**Wait for Installation to Complete**

After running npm install, npm will download and install the necessary packages and dependencies from the npm registry. This process may take a few moments, depending on your internet connection speed and the number of dependencies.

**Verify Installation**

Once the installation process completes, you should see a message indicating that the dependencies were installed successfully. Additionally, you can check for any error messages in the terminal.

**Additional Notes**

It's recommended to run npm install whenever you clone a new Docusaurus project or when new dependencies are added to the project.
Make sure you have an active internet connection during the installation process, as npm needs to download packages from the npm registry.
