Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools and resources set up on your local machine:

**1. Node.js (version 16.x or later) and npm:**

    * Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. Docusaurus relies on Node.js for its build and development processes.

    * npm (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for Node.js that allows you to install and manage dependencies.

    * You can download and install Node.js (which includes npm) from the Node.js official site.

**2. Git:**

    * Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to your code and collaborate with others.

    * You can download and install Git from the Git official site.

    * Ensure Git is installed by running git --version in your terminal or command prompt. You should see the installed version number.

**3. A Hosting Provider for Static Sites:**

To deploy your Docusaurus site, you'll need a hosting provider that supports static site hosting. Some popular options include:
GitHub Pages: A free hosting service provided by GitHub for hosting static sites directly from a GitHub repository.

    * Vercel: A cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions, known for its ease of use and powerful features.

    * Netlify: A comprehensive platform for deploying and managing modern web projects, offering free and paid plans.

Set up an account with your chosen hosting provider if you don't already have one.
