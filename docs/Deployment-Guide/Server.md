## Start the Development Server

Now that you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can start the development server to preview your Docusaurus site locally. The development server provides a convenient way to view and interact with your site during the development process.

**Running the Development Server**

To start the development server, run the following command in your project directory:

```
npm run start
```
This command will execute the script defined in your package.json file, which typically starts the Docusaurus development server.

**Preview Your Site Locally**

After running the command, the development server will initiate and start serving your Docusaurus site locally. By default, the server will bind to a local port (usually port 3000) and host your site.

**Real-Time Preview**

One of the benefits of using the development server is that it provides real-time preview capabilities. This means that as you make changes to your Docusaurus site's source code, the server will automatically rebuild your site and refresh the browser window to reflect the latest changes.

**Accessing Your Site**

Once the development server is up and running, you can access your Docusaurus site by navigating to the following URL in your web browser:

```
http://localhost:3000
```
This URL represents the local development server running on your machine.

**Editing Your Site**

With the development server running, you can now edit your Docusaurus site's source code. Whether you're modifying Markdown files, tweaking configuration settings, or customizing styles, any changes you make will be immediately reflected in the browser.

**Hot Reloading**

The development server employs hot reloading, which means that only the components or files that have changed will be reloaded, resulting in faster feedback cycles and a smoother development experience.
